1. ~~Removing "forget" concept to reset portals. I really like this idea but with the content of the game it doesn't feel
   good. There isn't really any reason to go back to previous rooms so "forgetting" is done whenever a lapis doesn't
   spawn and you get penalized for it. Instead the center portal will always take you to a new room~~
2. Lapis that are picked up now instead increase your stats permanently. You can never lose stats anymore (all values
   will start lower as a result). This also gives more reason to explore each room since it may have a lapis for stats
   or pages for story progression
3. Picking up a page immediately shows you the page. After reading it the "enemy" will respond with some dialogue. If
   you have already seen a page before it won't be shown again until the end
4. new page content!
5. Consider new enemy type "roamer" that moves randomly even without detecting
6. introduce zoomers sooner


new page content
```markdown
I stand in darkness of the mind
I can’t recall what came behind
All memory is but a haze
Of fear and torment, like a maze

I search and seek to realize
To bring the past back to my eyes
But whispers in the deathly dark
Bid me to cease, to disembark.

Always this lurker in the dark
Enjoins me with entreaties stark
Bids me to sink in the abyss
Of blessèd sleep of blissfulness

My soul doth drift upon this sea
Whose blackness doth consumeth me
This all surrounding shadow soars
But hark! A light upon the shores!

A lighthouse beacon in the mist
Stands like a bulwark to assist
My weary soul and darkened mind
To guide me to the truth so kind

Though sail I in forgetfulness
There is no greater bliss than this
That though my past’s in shadow bands
Christ holds it in eternal hands
```
